    " # Hands-On Tutorial: Automated Predictive \\(APL\\) in SAP HANA Cloud\n",
    " __14 __37 __7,162\n",
    " SAP HANA Cloud now includes the Automated Predictive Library \\(APL\\). Find out how to train ML models within SAP HANA Cloud\n",
    " automatically, without having to extract the data. Use the familiar SAP HANA Python Client API for ML to trigger the required\n",
    " calculations in the SAP HANA Cloud straight from your preferred Python environment. Most of the code is also relevant for SAP HANA\n",
    " on-premise.\n",

    " # Introduction / Use case\n",
    " SAP HANA Cloud is the latest evolution of SAP HANA. Released in March 2020, it combines the technology known from the on-premise\n",
    " version of SAP HANA with cloud benefits such as scalability.\n",
    " It contains many of the known SAP HANA engines, such as the Automated Predictive Library \\(APL\\). The APL, which is a highly\n",
    " automated ML framework, has also been evolving and now includes a \"Gradient Boosting Classification\". This new Gradient Boosting\n",
    " Classification automates the process of finding an ML model, similar to the previous APL. The new Gradient Classification approach\n",
    " however tends to result in stronger models. Since the APL product group is focussing further improving this approach, we suggest\n",
    " working with the new \"Gradient Boosting Classification\", as we do in this blog.\n",
    " The APL can be called through SQL or directly from Python. In this blog we make use of Python and the corresponding library\n",
    " hana\\_ml, which simplifies the calling of SAP HANA functionality. We will call the APL, but the library can also call the Predictive\n",
    " Algorithm Library \\(PAL\\).\n",
    " As example to work with the Gradient Boosting Classification, we will predict the affinity of a Banking customer to sign up for a\n",
    " term deposit, in which money can be locked for a certain period and accrues higher interest rates.\n",
    " # Setup SAP HANA Cloud\n",
    " To implement this Bank Marketing scenario you need access to SAP HANA Cloud. This SAP HANA Cloud with the following configuration:\n",
    "   - It must have at least 3 virtual CPUs \\(vCPUs\\). The current SAP HANA Cloud Trial comes only with 2 vCPUs. In that trial it is not possible to increase the number of vCPUs. Therefore you must create your own instance of SAP HANA Cloud in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit as described in this playlist from the SAP HANA Academy, which also contains plenty of additional material.\n",
    "   - Your SAP HANA Cloud must have the Script Server enabled to be able to use the Automated Predictive Library \\(APL\\). For a new SAP HANA Cloud instance the Script Server can be enabled when creating the instance. For existing sytems, the Script Server can be activated with a Service Request.\n",
    "   - Your SAP HANA Cloud must permit connections from your IP address, e.g. by selecting \"Allow all IP addresses\".\n",
    " The \"Getting Started with SAP HANA Cloud\" guide also gives an excellent overview, just bear in mind that you cannot use the trial\n",
    " environment to implement this blog's hands-on scenario. Denys van Kempen has also put together a huge collection of SAP HANA Cloud\n",
    " material. In case you might be a little puzzled about the different version of SAP HANA that have been around, Denys has also\n",
    " created a SAP \\(HANA\\) Cheat Sheet.\n",
    " There is also a Learning Article on Using Jupyter Notebooks with SAP HANA Cloud that helps with the first steps.\n",
    " To continue hands-on, you need to know:\n",
    "   - The SAP HANA Cloud endpoint \\(e.g. xyz.hanacloud.ondemand.com\\)\n",
    "   - The HTTPS port, which is always 443\n",
    "   - The password for the DBADMIN user\n",
    " # Setup local Python\n",
    " You need an environment to execute Python code. In case you already have an environment to work with, please use it. In case you are\n",
    " new to Python, we suggest installing Anaconda, which will install and configure everything that is needed.\n",
    " Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, open the Anaconda Navigator and select JupyterLab.\n",
    " An alternative, and much faster, approach to open JupyterLab is through the Anaconda Prompt. Open the Anaconda Prompt, then type:\n",
    " jupyter lab\n",
    " If you haven't worked with JupyterLab so far, not to worry It's easy to find your way around. One very useful introduction for the\n",
    " first steps is this tutorial from the California Institute of Technology \\(Caltech\\).\n",
    " With Python at your fingertips, create a new Python 3 Notebook and install SAP's hana\\_ml library, which provides the connectivity\n",
    " and push-down to the SAP HANA Cloud."
